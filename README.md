# What's this then?

The contents of this repository constitute my response to the second homework assignment done as part of a software development course. It seems the goal was to familiarise with both the structure of functions (within packages and modules) and the importance of writing good tests and then writing good code that passes those tests, rather than writing tests around messy code.


# OK, but... what does it actually do?

It's a fairly rudimentary Python implementation of a simple stock management system for a pet shop.

There is no front-end element to this code, it's just a series of functions which can be accessed from a command line interface. The task set here was to write code from scratch in `src/pet_shop.py` which would pass all the tests in `tests/pet_shop_test.py`. To check that it does, you can run `run_tests.py` from a terminal (which will call on both modules and run all the unit tests found in the test module).

The unit tests were not written by me, but rather provided with the assignment. I have included precisely what was provided within the `startpoint` directory and in the file `task.md` in the root directory.
